### Details

There are two command-prompts. In one command-prompt we have the Multicast Tool running in *listen* mode, and in the other in *send* mode.

We are executing two commands in the *send* command-prompt: one by entering the input in the command-prompt, and the other by sending the contents of a file to the application. Both the contents are received by *listen* application running in the background command-prompt.

Then in the *listen* mode prompt, we give the command *bye* to quit that version. You may also enter EOF character or other commands like _quit_, _exit_, _close_, _terminate_, _shutdown_, _hasta la vista_, _vanakkam_, _danyavada_ and _danyavaad_.

This tool is available as part of _"The Joy of Unix in Windows Tool Bundle"_:
